    <h1>Cory's Codeup Learning Map</h1>
    <h2>Prework</h2>
    <h3>HTML Forms</h3>
    <h4>Checkbox/Radio</h4>
    <p>Sticking Points</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Need to do some more looking into the syntax of adding zero to many answers (e.g. input is placed inside
            label elemenet</li>
        <ul>
            <li>name values all end in [] for backend languages to treat as arrays</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Radio button inputs are wrapped in a label</li>
        <li>Grouped radio buttons have the same name</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <h4>CSS Properties</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>CSS has a text-indent property. Who knew?</li>
        <li>Inheriting Styles: The inherit CSS-value causes the element for which it is specified to take the computed
            value of the property from its parent element. It is allowed on every CSS property.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>CSS Floats and Positionings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Float is really weird, and I need to come back and research it more. <em>BUT WHY NOT FLEXBOX???</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <h4>If/Else Statements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ternary Operator (Shorthand If/Else)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>message;
                if (success) {
                message = "Operation was successful.";
                } else {
                message = "Oops, something went wrong.";
                }</li>
            <li>var message = (success) ? "Operation was successful." : "Oops, something went wrong.";</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Switch Statements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use when you need a series of if/else statements ***it makes the code more readable!*
        </li>
        <li>
            Always use the method that makes code the most readable!!!
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>While Loops</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Do while loops executed the code FIRST and then the condition</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Scope</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>IIFE Immediately invoked function expressions -> Help the global object not become so cluttered.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Manipulating</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>lastIndexOf works backwards from the end!</li>
    </ul>
